# SCENARIO WITH USER
# 1. The user enters url to the browser and visits the site
# 2. The request comes to django and URLS.PY recieves it
# 3. URLS.PY checks the path and correctly identifies the view function
# 4. URLS.py passes the request to the fn and VIEWS.PY's fn creates 
#                                           a logical-response
# 5. The response is sent back to the user's browser
